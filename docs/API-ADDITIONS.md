# API additions

What this branch adds on top of upstream `main` (as of `0dd31ce`, 2026-10-02),
for review before merging. Everything here is new files except the short list
under "Changes to existing files".

Conventions followed from the existing code: `Router({ mergeParams: true })`,
`authenticate` → `resolveTenant` → `requirePermission(...)`, Joi schemas passed
to `validate({ params, query, body })`, `asyncHandler` controllers, `AppError`
for domain errors, `recordAudit` on every mutation, money in minor units.

## Migrations

Numbered 130–133 so they run after upstream's `129-create-billing-payment-attempts`.

| # | Adds |
|---|---|
| 130 | `low_stock_threshold` on `product_variants` |
| 131 | `workspace_integrations`, `whatsapp_conversations`, `whatsapp_messages` |
| 132 | `automation_runs` |
| 133 | `cod_settlements`, `cod_settlement_lines` |
| 134 | `webhook_order_states`, `webhook_scan_cursors`, and the `updated_at` / due-delivery indexes outbound webhooks scan |

## New endpoints

All workspace routes are under `/api/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId`.

### COD settlements — `/settlements`
Records what a courier actually remitted for delivered COD orders, and turns
that into real payments.

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/settlements/summary` | due from couriers, received, fees, draft count |
| GET | `/settlements/unsettled` | delivered COD orders not on any settlement, grouped by carrier |
| GET | `/settlements` | `?status&limit&before` |
| GET | `/settlements/:settlementId` | with its order lines |
| POST | `/settlements` | `{ carrierCode, reference?, periodStart?, periodEnd?, notes?, lines:[{orderId, collectedAmount?, feeAmount}] }` |
| PATCH | `/settlements/:settlementId` | draft only |
| DELETE | `/settlements/:settlementId` | draft only |
| POST | `/settlements/:settlementId/confirm` | writes a captured `cod` payment per line, updates `amountPaid` and the financial state, then locks the settlement |

Reads need `financial_reports.view`, writes need `refunds.manage`. An order can
appear on only one settlement (unique index on `workspace_id, order_id`).
Errors: `ORDER_NOT_SETTLEABLE`, `COLLECTED_EXCEEDS_DUE`, `DUPLICATE_ORDER` (422),
`SETTLEMENT_CONFIRMED` (409), `SETTLEMENT_EMPTY` (422).

### Order automations — `/automations`
| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET/POST | `/automations` | rule list and create |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/automations/:ruleId` | |
| GET | `/automations/runs` | what fired, what was skipped, and why |

Triggers: `order.created`, `order.confirmed`, `order.rejected`,
`order.cancelled`, `order.shipped`, `order.out_for_delivery`,
`order.delivered`. Action: `whatsapp_template`. Tokens: `{{customer_name}}`,
`{{order_number}}`, `{{order_total}}`, `{{store_name}}`, `{{tracking_url}}`,
`{{city}}`. The engine is fired from `transaction.afterCommit` and never throws
into the request — a failed run is recorded, not raised.

### WhatsApp Cloud API — `/whatsapp`
| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET/PUT/DELETE | `/whatsapp/integration` | credentials are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest (`INTEGRATIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`); the response only ever returns a masked token |
| GET | `/whatsapp/conversations` | `?status&search&limit&before` |
| PATCH | `/whatsapp/conversations/:conversationId` | close / reopen |
| GET | `/whatsapp/conversations/:conversationId/messages` | |
| POST | `/whatsapp/messages` | free text inside the 24h window, otherwise an approved template |

Public webhook, outside the workspace mount:
`GET|POST /api/v1/webhooks/whatsapp/:workspaceId` — verified with
`X-Hub-Signature-256` against the app secret, using `req.rawBody`.

### Server-side ad pixels — `/server-pixels`
| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET/PUT/DELETE | `/server-pixels/integration` | the Conversions API tokens for Meta, TikTok and Snapchat and the GA4 API secret, encrypted like the WhatsApp credentials and only ever returned masked |

A `Purchase` is sent server-side when an order is created (never for an order
still waiting for its online payment), with the order id as the event id so the
browser pixel's event dedupes against it. The public pixel IDs live in
`settings.tracking_pixels` (PATCH `/workspaces/:id`), and `GET /store/:workspaceId`
returns them in a read-only `tracking` block.

### API keys, public API and outbound webhooks
Full reference, with a signature-verification snippet, in `docs/public-api.md`.

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET/POST | `/api-keys` | list and create; the key (`zk_…`) is shown once, only its hash is stored. Scopes `orders:read`, `orders:write` |
| DELETE | `/api-keys/:keyId` | revoke |
| GET/POST | `/webhooks` | endpoints and the event catalogue; the signing secret is shown on create and on rotate |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/webhooks/:endpointId` | |
| POST | `/webhooks/:endpointId/rotate-secret`, `/test` | |
| GET | `/webhooks/:endpointId/deliveries` | the delivery log; `POST …/deliveries/:deliveryId/redeliver` resends one |

Public API, authenticated by the key (`Authorization: Bearer zk_…`), outside the workspace mount — `/api/v1/public`: `GET /me`, `GET /orders`, `GET /orders/by-number/:orderNumber`, `GET /orders/:orderId`, `GET /orders/:orderId/shipments`, `POST /orders/:orderId/confirmation`, `POST /orders/:orderId/cancel`, `POST /orders/:orderId/shipments`, `PATCH /orders/:orderId/shipments/:shipmentId`, `POST /orders/:orderId/cod-collected`.

Webhook events: `order.created`, `order.status_changed` (and `webhook.test`). Each request carries `X-Zimos-Signature: t=<unix>,v1=<HMAC-SHA256(secret, t + "." + body)>`. The module observes orders and shipments by `updated_at` instead of hooking each writer, so no order code was changed; `src/server.js` starts the loop (`WEBHOOKS_IN_PROCESS=false` leaves it to `scripts/dispatch-webhooks.js`).

### Merchant records
| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/audit-logs` | `?action&entityType&limit&before`, each entry with its actor |
| GET | `/invoices` | `?status&limit&before` |

## Changes to existing files

Kept as small as possible — nothing was restyled or refactored.

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/app.js` | requires and mounts for the routers above |
| `src/modules/orders/orderService.js` | `order.created` (automations, server pixels) and `order.cancelled` (automations) after commit |
| `src/modules/orders/shipmentLifecycle.js` | `order.shipped` / `order.out_for_delivery` / `order.delivered` automations when a shipment's status changes |
| `src/modules/cod/confirmationService.js` | `order.confirmed` / `order.rejected` automations after commit |
| `src/modules/storefront/storefrontService.js` | `getStorefront` also returns `tracking` |
| `src/modules/workspaces/workspaceService.js`, `workspaceValidation.js` | `tracking_pixels` in workspace settings |
| `src/modules/media/mediaService.js`, `mediaController.js` | GLB 3D models accepted (15MB ceiling, stored as uploaded) for the `product_3d` page element |
| `src/modules/catalog/catalogValidation.js`, `db/models/ProductVariant.js` | `lowStockThreshold` on variants |

## Dropped in favour of upstream's own implementation

Earlier versions of this branch carried these; upstream now has its own, so
ours were removed rather than merged: Bosta (→ `shipping/carriers`), Paymob
(→ `payments/gateways`), fraud rules (→ `modules/fraud`), abandoned checkouts
(→ `modules/checkoutSessions`), the shipping quote, orders list paging and
counts, web / funnel analytics, the media library list, merchant billing, the
platform-admin overview routes, and the billing webhook signature. The
confirmation call log and per-agent stats were removed with the call centre.

## Environment

```
INTEGRATIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=   # encrypts stored WhatsApp and server-pixel credentials; required in production
PUBLIC_API_URL=                # used to build the WhatsApp webhook URL shown in settings
META_GRAPH_API_VERSION=        # optional, defaults to v21.0
```

Without these keys the features report themselves as not connected. Nothing is
stubbed or faked.

## Tests

New suites: `settlements`, `automations`, `whatsapp`, `pixelEvents`,
`trackingPixels`, `merchantRecords`, `lowStockThreshold`, `immersiveBlocks`,
`nicheTemplates`.
