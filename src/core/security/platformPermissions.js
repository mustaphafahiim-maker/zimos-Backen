/**
 * Canonical list of platform-console permission keys. Every /api/v1/admin
 * route declares exactly one of these (core/middleware/platformAdminGuard.js);
 * a platform user holds them in `users.platform_permissions`.
 *
 * These are a separate namespace from the workspace permissions in
 * permissions.js: a workspace role never grants anything here, and a
 * platform role never grants anything inside a workspace.
 *
 * Roles are data (the `platform_roles` table): each one names a default
 * permission set that is copied onto an account when the role is assigned,
 * and a creator can then edit that account's set. So a check is always
 * "does this account hold the key", never "what role is it".
 *
 * '*' means every key, including ones added later, and is reserved for the
 * creator role — the same convention as the workspace Owner's '*'.
 *
 * Adding a key here means a migration that adds it to the `admin` role's
 * default set and to the admins who should have it; creators get it through
 * '*' without one.
