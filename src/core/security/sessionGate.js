/**
 * Ending a session cuts access at once: ending one device, ending
 * all of them, a password reset, a replayed refresh token. Revoking a session
 * already stopped its refresh token; the access token it had handed out kept
 * working until it expired (JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN, 15 minutes). Now the
 * access token names its session (`sid`), and every authenticated request
 * checks that session still stands.
 *
 * A refresh replaces the session row (authService.refresh): the old row is
 * revoked and points at the new one (`rotated_to_session_id`). An access token
 * from before the refresh is still good while that chain ends in a live
 * session — a request in flight during a refresh must not log the person out.
 * A revoked session has no successor, so the chain ends there.
 *
 * The answer is kept for CACHE_MS, so a busy dashboard does not ask the
 * database on every request. Any change to a session on this server empties
 * the cache (the hooks below), so here the cut is immediate. Another server
 * learns within CACHE_MS. A token without `sid`, issued before this change,
 * is let through until it expires.
