 * or unpaid past its grace day (workspaces/workspaceAccessService) — answers
 * 423 STORE_UNAVAILABLE on every public route, with just enough about the
 * store (name, locale) for the storefront to draw its "unavailable" page. No
 * catalogue, cart, checkout or order data is served.
 *
 * A draft store (not subscribed yet, see workspaceAccessService) answers
 * exactly as a store that does not exist — the same 404 — so nothing about
 * it, not even that it exists, reaches the public. Staff previewing it with
 * an X-Store-Preview token see its pages; `refuseDraftOrders` keeps them from
