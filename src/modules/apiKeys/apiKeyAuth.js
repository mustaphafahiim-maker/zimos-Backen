 * Reads the key from `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (or `X-API-Key`), and on
 * success leaves the request looking exactly like a staff request from the
 * key's creator — req.user, and req.tenant with the same shape resolveTenant
 * builds — so the route can use requirePermission and call the same services
 * the dashboard does. The one difference is req.tenant.hasPermission: the
 * creator's role AND the key's scopes (apiKeyService.SCOPES) must both allow
 * it. req.apiKey is the key row.
 *
 * Every failure is the same 401, whether the key is malformed, unknown,
 * revoked, its creator gone or its workspace suspended: an answer that
 * differed would tell a caller which of those it had guessed right.
