/**
 * A merchant's proof of a manual transfer (InstaPay, a mobile wallet) and a

 *
 *   open     POST /workspaces/:id/billing/invoices/open (billing.manage):
 *            what paying now comes to, writing nothing — the pending charge
 *            if one is open, otherwise the next one priced as createCharge
 *            would write it, under the id NEXT_CHARGE.
 *   send     POST /workspaces/:id/billing/invoices/:invoiceId/payment-proofs
 *            (billing.manage), `:invoiceId` a pending charge of the store or
 *            NEXT_CHARGE — the charge is then written (or the pending one
 *            taken) in the proof's own transaction, so only a sent proof
 *            holds a charge open. The method (an enabled manual one), the
 *            sender's Egyptian mobile number and the screenshot (JPEG, PNG
 *            or WebP by its bytes, at most PROOF_MAX_BYTES, re-encoded
 *            without its metadata and stored privately). The amount is the
 *            server's: the charge's amount payable now, frozen with its
 *            discount and code — the merchant never sends one; an
 *            `expectedAmount` (the amount the merchant was shown) is only
 *            compared with it. One image is never accepted twice (its
 *            SHA-256 is unique), one proof waits per charge, and at most
 *            MAX_OPEN_PER_WORKSPACE per store.
 *   top-up   POST /workspaces/:id/billing/wallet/topups (WALLET_ENABLED):
 *            the same checks, for an amount the merchant chooses between
 *            walletService.MIN_TOPUP_AMOUNT and MAX_TOPUP_AMOUNT, at most
 *            walletService.MAX_OPEN_TOPUPS waiting.
 *   review   the console (payments.record): the image through a signed
 *            five-minute link. Approving takes the amount that arrived; for
 *            a charge it must be exactly the amount asked, and the charge is
 *            settled through settlePaid — the path every payment takes — at
 *            the frozen price. Anything else is not settled: the proof is
 *            rejected with a note. A top-up credits what arrived, whatever was
 *            asked, through walletService.creditTopup (topup:<proofId>).
 *            Approving twice changes nothing.
