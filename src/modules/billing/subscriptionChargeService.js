/**
 * Subscription charges: one billing_invoices row per charge, the first and
 * every renewal alike.
 *
 * No payment gateway is connected for subscriptions yet. This is the seam a
 * gateway integration (a checkout, a renewal job) plugs into, and what the
 * platform console's "record payment" uses meanwhile. Two steps:
 *
 *   1. `createCharge` prices the next period and writes a pending invoice:
 *      the plan's price for the billing cycle, less the discount of the
 *      referral code attached to the subscription if that code is active
 *      now. The invoice records the gross price, the discount and the code.
 *      The invoice id is what a gateway should carry as its reference.
 *
 *   2. The charge is settled. Both ways in end in `settlePaid`, so they
 *      behave identically:
 *        - `markChargePaid` / `markChargeFailed`, reached through the signed
 *          billing webhook (`invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed`, see
 *          billingService). Idempotent: a redelivered event changes nothing.
 *        - `recordManualPayment`, a platform user recording a payment
 *          received outside any gateway: the amount actually received, and
 *          the date it arrived (default now; may be in the past).
 *
 *      A manual payment — only a manual one — can be undone with
 *      `reverseManualPayment`; gateway money really moved.
 *
 * The referral code is judged when the charge is PAID, not when it was
 * priced. At payment the code the charge was priced with is looked up again
 * (`payableNow`): if it is still active, its discount as configured now
 * applies and the paid charge writes one commission ledger row, in the same
 * transaction; if it has been deactivated, the charge is re-priced at the
 * full plan price, carries no code, and earns nothing. A charge priced with
 * no active code is not given one at payment — a code attached or
 * reactivated later applies from the next charge.

 *
 * Refused, with distinct codes, for a charge that isn't paid
 * (CHARGE_NOT_PAID) and for one the gateway confirmed
 * (PAYMENT_CONFIRMED_BY_GATEWAY): that money really moved, and undoing it is
 * a refund, not a correction. Also refused while the subscription has
 * another open charge (OPEN_CHARGE_EXISTS), since only one may be pending.
 *
 * The subscription goes to past_due — the status a failed payment already
 * produces — but only when this payment is what made it active (per the
 * snapshot the payment left on the charge). One that was already active
 * before it (a renewal paid early), or has since moved to another status
 * (past_due for another reason, cancelled), is left alone. Its period fields
 * are not touched, as a failed payment does not touch them either. Paying the
 * reopened charge again makes it active exactly as any payment does.
