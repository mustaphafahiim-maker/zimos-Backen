/**
 * One POST to a merchant's webhook URL. Resolves — never rejects — with
 * `{ status }` for any HTTP answer, or `{ status: null, error }` when there
 * was no answer (refused, timed out, blocked address, TLS failure).
 *
 * Plain http(s).request rather than fetch, for two reasons: its `lookup`
 * option lets webhookUrlGuard check the very address the socket connects to,
 * and it never follows a redirect — a 3xx is simply a non-2xx answer, so a
 * public URL cannot bounce the request onto our own network.
 *
 * The receiver's response body is read and thrown away: we keep the status
 * code, never what a merchant's server chose to send back.
