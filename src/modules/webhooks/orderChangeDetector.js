/**
 * Turns order changes into webhook deliveries — without any order writer
 * knowing it exists (see migration 117 for why it observes rather than being
 * called).
 *
 * One pass:
 *
 *   1. Takes the 'orders' cursor row with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED. Another
 *      scanner holding it means that scanner is doing this pass; this one
 *      returns straight away.
 *   2. Lists the orders whose row, or any of whose shipments, has an
 *      updated_at inside (cursor − OVERLAP, now] — only in workspaces with an
 *      active endpoint, so a store without webhooks costs nothing. The list
 *      is read in pages of BATCH_SIZE, keyset on (changed_at, order_id), until
 *      a page comes back short; only then does the cursor move to now. (It
 *      used to stop at a full batch and move the cursor to that batch's last
 *      time — but 500 orders changed inside one minute, by a bulk action or a
 *      settlement, put that time inside the next pass's overlap, so every
 *      pass re-read the same 500 and the cursor never moved again.)
 *   3. Derives each one's state the way the orders screen does
 *      (orders/orderStage.js) — stage, the three state machines and the
 *      latest shipment's status — and compares it with the snapshot from the
 *      last time it was seen (webhook_order_states).
 *   4. For each difference, writes one delivery per subscribed endpoint, and
 *      stores the new snapshot. The dispatcher sends them.
 *
 * OVERLAP: a transaction stamps updated_at when it writes, but becomes
 * visible when it commits — a slow commit can land "behind" a cursor that
 * already moved past its timestamp. Re-reading the last minute on every pass
 * catches those, and costs nothing when nothing changed: an unchanged
 * signature produces no event.
 *
 * Which event an endpoint gets:
 *
 *   order seen before, state differs    order.status_changed, with `previous`
 *   order never seen, placed after the  order.created
 *     endpoint was added
 *   order never seen, older than the    order.status_changed with previous
 *     endpoint (an order from before     null — its state is news, its
 *     webhooks, changing now)            previous state isn't known
