/**
 * The analytics reports: sales, products, delivery (the COD reality) and
 * customers, plus the insights drawn from them. Each report is one request
 * and is aggregated in Postgres; nothing is loaded into the API process.
 *
 * Definitions, so every number can be explained to a merchant:
 *
 *   order             a placed order that counts as a sale (a prepaid order
 *                     never paid is an abandoned payment), test orders excluded
 *   live order        an order that is neither cancelled nor rejected
 *   gross sales       items subtotal of live orders, before discounts
 *   net sales         gross sales − discounts − refunds
 *   total sales       what the customers were asked to pay (net + shipping + tax)
 *   delivered sales   total of the orders that reached the customer — on cash
 *                     on delivery this is the money that actually comes in
 *   conversion rate   orders ÷ sessions
 *   confirmation rate confirmed COD orders ÷ COD orders
 *   delivery rate     delivered ÷ orders that left with a courier
 *   return rate       returned or failed ÷ orders that left with a courier
 *
 * Rates are percentages with one decimal (`rate()` of analyticsService).
 *
 * Money is in the store's base currency, in minor units.
