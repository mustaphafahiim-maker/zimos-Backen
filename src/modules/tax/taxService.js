/**
 * Computes tax for a set of order lines using the workspace's configured
 * TaxRate rows: a product-specific rate takes precedence over the
 * workspace-wide default for that country/region. Prices-include-tax mode
 * is supported by treating the rate as already baked into the line price
 * (returning 0 additional tax, since the amount was already collected) —
 * callers that need the *implied* tax portion for reporting can derive it
 * from rateBasisPoints separately.
 *
 * Tax is opt-in: unless workspace.settings.tax_enabled is true this returns
 * zero tax regardless of how many TaxRate rows exist.
 *
 * `transaction`: the caller's, when it prices inside one (order creation and
 * edits). A read outside it would wait for a second pooled connection while
 * the transaction holds the first, and a burst of checkouts starves the pool.
